**Version**: 0.1
**Date**: January 2026
**Purpose**: Visual design reference for dimensional anomalies and rift-related content

## 1. The Nature of Rifts

### 1.1 What Rifts Are

Rifts are tears in dimensional fabric—places where Earth's reality intersects with other dimensions. They are not magical in the traditional sense but rather represent alternative physics bleeding through from parallel universes.

**Core Concept**: Rifts are wounds in reality. They're beautiful, terrible, and incomprehensible.

### 1.2 Visual Philosophy

**Hybrid Aesthetic Principle**:
Rift phenomena should feel simultaneously:
- **Organic** (growth patterns, natural forms)
- **Crystalline** (geometric, sharp, precise)
- **Energetic** (flowing, pulsing, alive)
- **Wrong** (uncanny valley of physics)

**Color as Information**:
- Purple: Stable rift energy
- Teal: Active dimensional flux
- Green: Unstable/corruption
- Red: Dangerous/explosive rift activity
- Multiple colors: Complex/powerful phenomena

## 2. Rift Classification & Visual Design

### 2.1 Dormant Rifts (Crystallized Scars)

**Status**: The rift has closed or stabilized; only residual energy remains

**Visual Characteristics**:

**Crystal Formations**:
- Hexagonal prisms (primary structure)
- 2-15 feet tall typically
- Cluster patterns radiating from rift center
- Semi-transparent with internal glow
- Purple-to-clear gradient (center to edges)
- Smooth facets reflecting light
- Faint hum (audible when close)
- Warm to touch (10-15°F above ambient)

**Environmental Impact**:
- Ground around rift has geometric cracking (hexagonal pattern)
- Vegetation grows in unusual colors (purples, blues in leaves)
- Small floating particles (dust-sized rift energy) drift slowly upward
- Light refracts strangely near crystals (slight prismatic effect)
- Animals avoid area (circle around)

**Light Behavior**:
- **Day**: Crystals catch sunlight, rainbow refractions, purple core glow visible
- **Night**: Soft purple-blue glow (enough to read by within 10 feet)
- **Weather**: Glow intensifies during storms (sympathetic reaction)

**Sound**:
- Faint crystalline resonance (like glass being lightly struck)
- Changes pitch with wind
- Harmonic undertones (pleasant but eerie)

**Art Direction Notes**:
- **Mood**: Beautiful but alien. Safe enough to approach, unsettling to touch.
- **Reference**: Combine quartz crystal caves + bioluminescent caves + aurora borealis
- **VFX**: Subtle particle drift, gentle pulsing glow, light refraction
- **Scale**: Small (2-4 crystals, 5ft tall) to Large (dozens of crystals, 15ft tall)

### 2.2 Active Rifts (Ongoing Dimensional Breach)

**Status**: Rift is open and actively connecting dimensions

**Visual Characteristics**:

**The Rift Itself**:
- Vertical tear in space (irregular shape, 6-20 feet tall)
- Edges shimmer with energy (purple-teal gradient)
- Center shows other dimension (alien landscape visible)
- Depth is impossible (2D surface that suggests infinite depth)
- Edge tendrils (energy wisps reaching outward)
- Constant movement (like surface of disturbed water)

**Energy Discharge**:
- Lightning-like arcs (purple-teal, branch patterns)
- Emanate from rift edges
- Strike ground, leaving crystalline scorch marks
- Frequency: 1 every 30-60 seconds
- Accompanied by sharp crack sound (like thunder, but musical)

**Distortion Field**:
- Sphere of influence (20-50 foot radius)
- Gravity anomalies:
  - Objects drift slowly
  - Dust and debris float
  - Water runs in curves or upward
- Visual distortion:
  - Lens effect (warped view)
  - Color shift (purple-teal tint)
  - Chromatic aberration at edges
  - Motion blur even on static objects

**Environmental Transformation**:
- Ground cracking and lifting (floating chunks)
- Vegetation growing rapidly (rift-touched mutations)
- Crystals forming in real-time (slow, visible growth)
- Air shimmer (heat mirage effect but with color)
- Wind pulls toward rift (gentle, constant)

**Creatures & Entities**:
- Dimensional beings emerge periodically
- Silhouettes visible within rift before emergence
- Energy wisps (minor entities) swirl around rift
- Wildlife warped by proximity (mutations visible)

**Light Behavior**:
- **Day**: Rift glow competes with sun, visible as purple-teal column
- **Night**: Dominates landscape, intense illumination (read by 100ft away)
- **Storm**: Interacts with lightning, color mixing

**Sound**:
- Deep thrumming (bass frequency, felt in chest)
- Crackling energy (constant, like electrical arc)
- Whistling wind (pulled toward rift)
- Otherworldly echoes (sounds from other dimension)
- Periodic energy discharge (sharp crack)

**Art Direction Notes**:
- **Mood**: Awesome (in original sense), terrifying, magnificent. Power beyond human scale.
- **Reference**: Aurora + lightning storm + portal sci-fi concepts + cosmic horror
- **VFX**: Heavy particle systems, lens distortion, floating debris, energy arcs, dimension view
- **Danger**: Clearly hazardous, beautiful but deadly

### 2.3 Unstable Rifts (Dimensional Chaos)

**Status**: Rift is expanding, contracting, or otherwise critically unstable

**Visual Characteristics**:

**Chaotic Behavior**:
- Rift tears open and partially closes (pulsing, 5-15 second cycle)
- Multiple tears forming and sealing (fractal branching)
- Size varies dramatically (10ft to 50ft)
- Shape irregular and changing
- Energy output spikes randomly

**Extreme Distortion**:
- Reality warping visible to naked eye
- Objects phase in/out of existence
- Geometry becomes non-Euclidean (impossible angles)
- Temporal distortion (motion appears to stutter or speed)
- Multiple simultaneous states visible (quantum superposition effect)

**Energy Storm**:
- Constant lightning (every 1-5 seconds)
- Arcs between multiple rift tears
- Ground electrified (visible current flow)
- Energy tornado (vortex pulling toward main rift)
- Color cycling (purple → teal → green → red, indicating instability)

**Environmental Destruction**:
- Ground shattering (large chunks floating)
- Structures dissolving or transforming
- Vegetation growing, dying, mutating rapidly
- Temperature swings (cold to hot)
- Air becoming unbreathable (alien atmosphere mixing)

**Rift Storm Propagation**:
- Distortion sphere expanding outward
- Wavefront visible (reality ripple)
- Everything in path affected
- Can grow to 1-mile radius
- Eventually stabilizes or collapses catastrophically

**Light Behavior**:
- Strobing, pulsing, chaotic
- All colors of rift spectrum cycling
- Painful brightness during energy spikes
- Deep shadow during contractions
- Light sources nearby flicker or fail

**Sound**:
- Deafening roar (like jet engine + earthquake)
- Reality tearing (indescribable, horrifying)
- Screaming winds
- Energy crackling (constant)
- Dimensional bleed (sounds from other worlds)
- Potential silence moments (terrifying contrast)

**Art Direction Notes**:
- **Mood**: Apocalyptic horror, reality breaking, flee immediately
- **Reference**: Nuclear explosion + Lovecraftian cosmic horror + glitch art + disaster films
- **VFX**: Maximum chaos, all effects at once, overwhelming sensory input
- **Danger**: Unsurvivable at close range, catastrophic
