# Andara's World — Settlement Archetypes & Visual Design

**Version**: 0.1
**Date**: January 2026
**Purpose**: Detailed settlement design for prototype and art direction

---

## 1. Settlement Design Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles

**Functional Beauty**: Every element serves a purpose. Beauty emerges from clever problem-solving and care taken with limited resources.

**Visible History**: Settlements show their growth through layers—original ruins, first shelters, current structures, ongoing repairs.

**Cultural Identity**: Each settlement type reflects its inhabitants' values and priorities through architecture, decoration, and organization.

**Wonder Amid Ruin**: Even desperate settlements have moments of beauty—a painted wall, a garden, light through colored glass.

### 1.2 Visual Hierarchy

**Primary Visual Elements** (What player sees first):
- Silhouette/skyline
- Defensive structures
- Lighting (especially at dusk/night)
- Color accents against wasteland browns

**Secondary Visual Elements** (What creates depth):
- Texture variation in materials
- Signs of habitation (smoke, movement, sound)
- Pathways and organization
- Improvised infrastructure

**Tertiary Visual Elements** (What rewards exploration):
- Personal decorations
- Environmental storytelling details
- Hidden functional elements
- Cultural artifacts

## 2. Prototype Settlement: Haven's Rest

### 2.1 Overview

**Classification**: Waystation Settlement (Semi-Permanent)
**Population**: ~120 permanent, +30 transient (traders, travelers)
**Founded**: 15 years post-Convergence (established, mature settlement)
**Location**: Junction of two old highways, near dried riverbed with underground water

**Strategic Importance**:
- Crossroads between larger settlements
- Reliable water source
- Defensible position (slight elevation, clear sightlines)
- Rift zone 12 miles east (source of materials, danger)

### 2.2 Layout & Districts
