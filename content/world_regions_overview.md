**Version**: 0.1
**Date**: January 2026
**Purpose**: World-building foundation for visual development and content creation

## 1. World Geography Post-Convergence

The Convergence shattered Earth's geography. Continents cracked, rifts tore through reality, and dimensional energy reshaped landscapes. What remains is a patchwork world where familiar ruins stand beside impossible terrain.

### 1.1 The Shattered Lands (Setting Region)

The primary game region encompasses what was once the North American Great Plains and surrounding areas. The Convergence hit this region particularly hard—massive rifts still scar the landscape, creating zones of dimensional instability alongside relatively stable wasteland.

**Key Geographic Features:**
- **The Rift Scar**: A 200-mile wound across the former Kansas plains where reality itself is unstable
- **The Dust Ocean**: Endless windswept wastes of fine ash and degraded topsoil
- **The Rust Belt Ruins**: Collapsed cities and industrial zones, now picked over by scavengers
- **The Green Creep**: Areas where rift-touched vegetation grows with unnatural vigor
- **The Dead Zones**: Radiation-scarred areas from pre-Convergence wars and post-Convergence disasters

### 1.2 Climate Post-Convergence

**General Patterns:**
- More extreme temperature swings (day/night, seasonal)
- Unpredictable weather near rift zones
- Perpetual dust storms in certain regions
- "Rift storms" that warp local reality temporarily
- Longer, harsher winters; shorter, scorching summers

**Atmospheric Quality:**
- Generally breathable but dusty
- Toxic pockets near industrial ruins
- Rift zones may have alien atmospheres
- Radiation lingers in old war sites

## 2. Biome Classification System

The world divides into distinct biomes, each with unique visual identity, hazards, and resources.

### 2.1 Wasteland Proper (Primary Biome)

**Visual Identity:**
- Rolling plains of cracked earth and dust
- Scattered ruins barely visible above the flatness
- Distant horizons broken by rift-glow on the skyline
- Golden-brown palette with pops of rust and faded colors
- Sunlight filters through perpetual dust haze creating dramatic god rays

**Key Features:**
- Wide open spaces creating vulnerability
- Limited cover except ruins and rock formations
- Dust devils and wind constantly moving
- Weathered roads still faintly visible
- Telegraph poles and power lines fallen or standing at angles

**Flora:**
- Scrub brush, tumbleweeds, hardy grasses
- Occasional rift-touched plants with bioluminescent qualities
- Dead trees, bleached white
- Patches of surprising wildflowers after rare rains

**Fauna:**
- Wasteland predators (mutated coyotes, hawks)
- Scavenger birds circling above
- Insects, especially near water
- Occasional rift-spawned creatures

**Resource Availability:**
- Water: Scarce (wells, rare streams)
- Food: Hunting, foraging (minimal)
- Scrap: Low density, requires travel
- Shelter: Rare, usually ruins

### 2.2 Settlement Zones (Human-Controlled Areas)

**Visual Identity:**
- Improvised architecture mixing salvaged materials
- Defensive perimeters (walls of sheet metal, sandbags, wrecked vehicles)
- Visible human activity: laundry lines, smoke from fires, solar panels
- Warm light spilling from windows at dusk
- Gardens and water collection systems
- Organized chaos—functional but jury-rigged

**Settlement Tiers:**

#### 2.2.1 Scavenger Camps (Temporary)
- 5-20 people
- Tents, trailers, temporary structures
- Focused around a resource (water, salvage site, caravan route)
- Minimal defenses
- **Art Notes**: Makeshift, mobile feel. Tarps, ropes, repurposed materials. Ready to abandon.

#### 2.2.2 Waystation Settlements (Semi-Permanent)
- 50-200 people
- Mix of repaired buildings and new construction
- Trading post, basic services (water, repairs, lodging)
- Defensive walls or barriers
- **Art Notes**: Cobbled together but stable. Signs, merchant stalls, communal areas. Shows pride in maintenance.

#### 2.2.3 Fortified Towns (Permanent)
- 200-1000 people
- Organized districts (market, residential, industrial)
- Strong defenses, militia presence
- Water purification, farming (greenhouses or irrigated fields)
- Power generation (solar, wind, salvaged generators)
- **Art Notes**: Almost pre-Convergence normalcy in protected areas. Streets, lighting systems, organized infrastructure. Contrast between interior safety and exterior wasteland.

### 2.3 Rift Zones (Dimensional Anomalies)

**Visual Identity:**
- Reality distortion effects: warped geometry, floating debris, impossible colors
- Rift energy manifests as crystalline formations, energy auroras, floating particles
- Color palette shifts: purples, teals, unnatural greens bleeding into normal browns/grays
- Gravity anomalies: objects floating, water running upward
- Time feels wrong: motion blur, afterimages, stuttering movement

**Rift Classification by Stability:**

#### 2.3.1 Dormant Rifts
- Crystallized energy formations remain
- Minimal active distortion
- Residual magical ambient
- **Art Notes**: Beautiful but eerie. Crystal gardens, frozen moments of chaos. Safe to approach but unsettling.

#### 2.3.2 Active Rifts
- Visible tears in reality
- Energy discharge, floating debris field
- Dimensional creatures may emerge
- Unpredictable effects on equipment and environment
- **Art Notes**: Dynamic, dangerous beauty. Swirling energy, lens distortion effects, dramatic lighting from rift-glow.

#### 2.3.3 Unstable Rifts
- Expanding/contracting
- Severe reality warping in area
- "Rift storms" propagate outward
- Extreme danger
- **Art Notes**: Apocalyptic beauty. Sky tears open, landscape transforms, impossible vistas visible through rifts. Terrifying wonder.

**Flora in Rift Zones:**
- Crystalline "plants" growing from rift energy
- Bioluminescent fungal masses
- Trees with bark that shifts colors
- Flowers that exist in multiple states simultaneously

**Fauna in Rift Zones:**
- Dimensional creatures: varied, alien
- Mutated local fauna warped by rift exposure
- Energy beings (wisps, shades)
- Predatory anomalies that defy classification

### 2.4 Ruin Zones (Urban Decay)

**Visual Identity:**
- Skeletal buildings, collapsed infrastructure
- Nature reclaiming concrete and steel

- Layered history visible: pre-Convergence ads, post-Convergence survivor markings

**Ruin Types:**

#### 2.4.1 Suburban Sprawl
- Neighborhoods of collapsed houses
- Overgrown streets, trees through roofs
- Personal artifacts scattered (cars, furniture, belongings)
- **Art Notes**: Melancholic. Nature's patient victory. Quiet, ghostly.

#### 2.4.2 Commercial Districts
- Strip malls, big box stores (now scavenger havens)
- Parking lots cracked and sprouting vegetation
- Faded signage, broken glass everywhere
- **Art Notes**: Consumer culture's corpse. Ironic juxtaposition of advertisements and decay.

#### 2.4.3 Industrial Complexes
- Factories, warehouses, power plants
- Massive scale, metal and concrete
- Hazardous materials, toxic zones
- High-value salvage (machinery, chemicals, tech)
- **Art Notes**: Imposing, dangerous. Brutalist architecture. Sense of scale that dwarfs humans.

#### 2.4.4 City Centers
- High-rises, some collapsed, some standing
- Deep shadow canyons between buildings
- Skybridges broken or intact
- Vertical exploration opportunities
- **Art Notes**: Gothic verticality. Sunlight shafts through broken towers. Sense of lost grandeur.

### 2.5 The Green Creep (Rift-Touched Wilderness)

**Visual Identity:**
- Aggressive plant growth, unnatural colors
- Bioluminescence at night
- Plant life that moves or reacts
- Vibrant greens, purples, blues against wasteland browns
- Humid microclimate, mist and fog

**Characteristics:**
- Appears near dormant rifts or where rift energy saturated ground
- Grows faster than normal plants, spreads slowly
- May be beautiful or threatening depending on plant type
- Source of unique organic materials
- Home to rift-touched creatures

**Art Notes**: Alien Eden. Beautiful but wrong. A garden that shouldn't exist. Vibrant colors that feel out of place. Wonder with undercurrent of threat.

## Next Steps for Art Development

1. **Concept Art Briefs**: Use this document to create specific scene descriptions for artists
2. **Mood Boards**: Assemble reference images matching each biome and lighting condition
3. **3D Asset Pipeline**: Define which materials and architectural elements are highest priority
4. **Character Design**: Ensure character equipment and clothing fits established material library
5. **UI Integration**: Color palettes should inform UI design to maintain cohesion
